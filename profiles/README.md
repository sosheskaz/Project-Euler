# Performance Profiles

These profiles are auto-generated using `autoprofile` in the root of this project. They are
available in [JSON](perfprofile.json), [YAML](perfprofile.yml), [CSV](perfprofile.csv), and
[Markdown](perfprofile.md) formats.

These numbers are all relative, but I do include hardware information in the
[hwinfo.txt](hwinfo.txt)
