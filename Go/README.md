# Notes

* The way I set up Golang here, where each file is an entrypoint, I can't easily reference code from
other problems, so I usually copy/paste. Putting them in each other's paths would either necessitate
figure out dynamic linking, or statically compiling everything any time I want to run a problem. I
haven't implemented either.
